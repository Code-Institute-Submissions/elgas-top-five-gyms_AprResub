        The user has two options, click the buttons or scroll down to see a map with markers of the three cities.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I would like to see the best gyms that the website mentions.

        When the user clicks the city names buttons, they are ridirected to the page with the list of gyms of that city.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want the website to redirect to the best gyms in Swedens biggest cities.
